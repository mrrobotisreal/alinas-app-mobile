  "textsList.introduction": "\t\t\tAlina, first and foremost, I wish to tell you that I love you with all of my heart, mind, body, and soul. I think you already know that, but I could never tell you too many times. Truly, my feelings and my love for you grow bigger, stronger, and brighter with every passing moment. This book and all the words contained herein are a representation of how I feel, but please know that they could never compare to how I truly feel for you. That being said, I wish for this book to serve you as a reminder of me and how I feel about you while we are not able to physically be together.\n\t\t\tI told you before that I was an open book for you to read and I will gladly share anything and everything with you that you wish to know. This book is proof that I really mean what I say to you, so please remember that when I tell you how much I love you, how much I treasure you, and how much you truly mean to me. You have also told me before that you wish for me to continue writing ‚Äúmy book‚Äù for you to read, and in response to you telling me this I just have one thing to say‚Ä¶ As you wish, my world, I will gladly do anything for you. And I decided to put at least some of it down onto paper for you to read any time you want.\n\t\t\tWhen you are feeling lonely and missing me, but I‚Äôm asleep or at work, I‚Äôll be right here in this book waiting to talk to you and keep you company. If you are having an amazing time and wish to share wonderful things with me, but for whatever reason you don‚Äôt have a signal on your mobile phone, please come here and tell me all about it in the section at the back of this book for you to write in. Whether you are feeling happy, sad, or in between, I will always be here for you. I don‚Äôt just mean in this book either, however, I hope this book will find you well in the times when we are not able to talk or see each other.\n\n",

But what is ‚Äúeverything‚Äù? This is something you‚Äôve asked me several times to tell you when we are finally together in Portugal. Of course I will do exactly as you wish, and I will also tell you in this book my world, because there may be times when you wish to come back and read it again and again, and let‚Äôs face it, scrolling back through our massive amount of texts isn‚Äôt that easy.\n\t\t\tYou should know, however, that ‚Äúeverything‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean just one thing. It means many things, and they can be placed into two categories, at least for the sake of elaborating it to you in this book. The first category has to do with when I am telling you that ‚Äúyou are my everything‚Äù, and as you might have guessed, the second category has to do with when I am telling you that ‚ÄúI want everything with you‚Äù. Let‚Äôs go ahead and dive right into what these are made of and what they mean!\n\n",

  "textsList.my_love_content": "\t\t\tLove is such a powerful word, and there are so many different ways to use this word. I love breakfast! I love to dance! I love to read! And‚Ä¶. I love <u>YOU</u>. It‚Äôs almost a shame that in English, we don‚Äôt have a specific word that is reserved purely for expressing love and affection towards another person. Don‚Äôt let the multi-faceted use of this word fool you though. Deep within ‚Äùlove‚Äù, there is hidden power and beauty, much like a diamond deep within the Earth. It all depends how you say it, who you say it to, and when you say it.\n\t\t\t‚ÄúBut, my world, how does this relate to me being your everything?‚Äù you might ask. And I‚Äôd tell you that it‚Äôs related because much like the multi-faceted usage of this word, my love for you is also many-sided like the shapes of finely crafted and cut gems, which cause the light to refract and twinkle brightly in all directions. You are my love Alina, truly, you are the love of my life and the only woman I ever wish to be with in my life. I understand that is quite a powerful statement to make, but bear with me here and I think it‚Äôll begin to make more sense as I explain.\n\t\t\tYou see, when I look at you I can see how incredibly special, precious, beautiful, and powerful you are. Much like a jeweler pays close attention to the jewels they polish and every so slightly shape in order to let the light in to refract and magnify the beauty contained within, I wish to do the same for you, my love. Your beauty is like a bright light inside of you, and when I look at you, I see the real you and the brilliantly beautiful light you have shining within you. My love, I wish to polish every side of you that I can see, and watch your beauty shine brighter and brighter every day of my life‚Ä¶\n\n\t\t\tBut you are my love Alina, my one true love, the love of my entire life, and it just doesn‚Äôt seem like something as inanimate as a ruby or diamond does this explanation justice. No, my world, my love, you are so much more than even the most precious of gems and jewels that have ever been found or known to exist in the world. You are alive, and my love for you is alive and growing every day, with every breath. What better representation than a beautiful flower?\n\t\t\tYou are also my precious flower whom I wish to water every day with my love and care and attention, because with every moment, I see you blooming a little bit more into the magnificent and awe-inspiringly beautiful flower that I know you are. When I first met you in person in Prague, I could see you were so incredibly special and beautiful like a rose, but you had yet to bloom. I wasn‚Äôt about to miss the chance to watch you bloom into the amazing woman I know you are and that you will become, so I began watering you with every chance I got, by telling you how amazing you are and how I feel about you.\n\t\t\tI want you to know that I love you very much, Alina, more than I ever imagined was even possible, and I do not say this lightly. I mean it with every molecule of my being, and I wish for you to feel this love as I water you with my affection and care for you gently, sweetly, and passionately like the delicate and precious flower that I know you are. Just because something is delicate doesn‚Äôt mean it is weak either, so please do not think that anything bad is meant by saying you are delicate. No, in fact some of the most beautiful and incredible things in the world are delicate and intricately held together, and this only adds so much more to their beauty, to your beauty.\n\t\t\tI wish to be your gardener; I will care for you and protect you, and I will love you every day of my life. You can be sure of this my world. I will do anything for you, and I would truly cross the oceans and the mountains to be with you, to protect you, to care for you, to provide for you, to love you, and so much more.\n\t\t\tWe have something truly special and amazing together, Alina. Many people in the world dream of having something like what we have, and I do not take what we have for granted nor I do not want to waste or miss this opportunity of a lifetime. I want you in my life, for life, bottom line‚Ä¶ I am in love with you Alina, you are my love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_title": "My Happiness\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_content": "\t\t\tHappiness truly is a feeling so great that the word ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù could never fully encompass the vast breadth and depth of what I actually feel when I am with you. What exactly is happiness anyway? Some might say it‚Äôs a good feeling that you experience while doing something you like, such as playing piano, dancing to a song you like, laughing at a funny movie, etc‚Ä¶ While I do agree that I would feel happy doing these activities too, this just isn‚Äôt what kind of happiness I‚Äôm talking about.\n\t\t\tNo, the kind of happiness I am talking about truly does extend much further beyond the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù experienced while doing these enjoyable activities. When I say you are my happiness, Alina, I mean that you are the spark, the light, and the life within me that makes everything in life so much better and so much brighter. With you, my happiness, there is always a silver lining and warm light shining through even the darkest of days with gray skies and dim feelings. Bright days that are already filled with happiness and excitement of their own, well, my happiness, when you are with me they become truly unforgettable.\n\t\t\tI can tell you with certainty that before you came into my life, I didn‚Äôt know what real happiness was. Sure, I <i>thought</i> I knew what it meant to truly be happy, but in fact I had no idea what it really meant. You showed me the way, Alina, you lit my path as I walked through life with you and everything became brighter and sweeter, and I could see even the finest of details in everything around me. If you‚Äôve ever looked closely at the stitches in a piece of finely woven clothing with intricate patterns, then you‚Äôll understand when I say that when I am with you, I am so happy that I can see the elaborate and magnificent weave in all things around me, even in the dullest of objects and the blandest of subjects.\n\t\t\tYou see, my happiness, ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù is actually a combination of many feelings working together in harmony with each other, and the actual ‚Äújoy‚Äù and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù we feel is an emergent property emanating out of this harmony. We can definitely find enjoyment and pleasure in life by ourselves, of course, but true happiness is not something we could achieve or find on our own, and when we do find it, it is greater than the sum of any amount of pleasure or enjoyment we could get or find on our own. You are my happiness, Alina, because without you, I would never have known what this harmonic blessing of a feeling meant or felt like.\n\t\t\tSometimes, no, very often actually, I say to myself ‚Äúwow‚Äù, full of wonder and awe. There is nothing in my life that has ever even come close to this kind of happiness I have with you, my world. You‚Äôve seen it in me, I know, but I still feel like telling you this‚Ä¶ Every time I see your beautiful smile, deep blue eyes, long golden hair, and hear your heart melting voice and your spirit lifting laughter, I truly cannot help but smile and feel the utmost elation and wonder. I don‚Äôt know how you do this to me, every single time I see you, and I don‚Äôt need to know, but I truly treasure you and you are so precious to me, more than these words could ever describe.\n\t\t\tYou really are my happiness Alina; ‚Äúyes‚Äù ;-), you are. There is something special about you, and I have felt that ever since the moment I met you, but now I really see that brilliant light inside of you growing brighter by the day, with each passing moment. Maybe it‚Äôs because I am seeing just how special and amazing you are more every day, maybe it‚Äôs because that light inside of you is growing brighter every day, or maybe it‚Äôs a combination of both, but I can see it, sense it, and feel it, and it‚Äôs the most beautiful and incredible thing I‚Äôve ever seen. That light I‚Äôm talking about, it‚Äôs you; you are the most beautiful and incredible woman I have ever seen, ever met, ever known. You are my happiness, Alina, and you are my harmony, and you are singing and shining the most breathtaking symphony ever to exist inside of me.\n\nI once read a quote about happiness that said:\n\n‚ÄùHappiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.‚Äù\n\t\t\t- Mahatma Gandhi\n\n\t\t\tI would like to take this quote even a bit further with you, my happiness, because the happiness I feel with you goes beyond myself, and it is not just about me. The happiness I feel with you is also when what I think is what you say, when what you think is what I say, and when what we do is in unison. I‚Äôm sure you have noticed all of the times when I‚Äôve ‚Äúread your mind‚Äù, and I sure have noticed all the times when you have read my mind; we are in harmony together, we are happy together, we are one together, and we belong together. Alina, I love you very much and I have never been happier before in my life, truly. YOU are my happiness, and because of you, now I know what true happiness is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_title": "My Strength\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content": "\t\t\t^ Maybe you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúwhat in the world does this steel wire rope have to do with me being your strength‚Äù? Well my world, let me tell you, because I find that it is actually quite fitting. Oftentimes the greatest amount of strength possible comes from the unification of many small components working together, being flexible, and using physics and leverage, rather than resisting physics and gravity. If you really want to dive deep, think of the incredible and almost unfathomable amount of energy stored inside the atoms of a molecule, and how incomprehensibly many molecules make up even just a centimeter of one of these tiny steel wires.\n\t\t\tMuch like each of these individual strands that are woven together, which make the rope as a whole incredibly strong and also flexible by distributing the pressure evenly in all directions, the little things you tell me and do for me hold me together and make me stronger than I could ever be by myself. Before you entered my life, I was like a single thick, inflexible strand trying to hold all the pressure of life by myself. I‚Äôm sure I probably don‚Äôt even need to say it, but trying to handle all of that stress and pressure rigidly by myself is a fracture waiting to happen. But now that you are here, now that you are in my life, you are my strength; you always tell me little sweet things that lift me up, give me encouragement, boost my confidence, remind me that my attitude is a choice and directly impacts the way I experience life, and help me to see that success is near.\n\t\t\tEach of these seemingly ‚Äúlittle‚Äù things you do for me, are actually making up the individual steel wires that wrap around each other, giving me the strength and the flexibility to know that even when the pressure is intense, you are always here in many ways, and sometimes I just need to give way to the pressure a little bit in this direction or that direction until it evens back out. My world, thank you so much for every ‚Äúlittle‚Äù thing you do for me. I appreciate you so much, I absolutely treasure you and I recognize how amazing you are and the things you do for me.. Maybe it isn‚Äôt very apparent on the surface at times, but inside you build me up and support me, and I know that no matter what life throws at me, I will be okay.\n\t\t\tBut this goes beyond just being okay. In fact, with you I feel that I can think big and I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, and overcome any obstacle. There is, however, another aspect to strength that sometimes gets overlooked, but it is very important and very powerful. This aspect is fear. I know, I know my world, but just hear me out.\n\t\t\tFear definitely has very negative connotations, but it is also an incredibly powerful tool, and there is a reason nature has imbued it with such power in our minds and bodies. It drives us to recognize and act upon what is both important and dangerous for our survival and happiness. This is also a slippery slope though, because fear has such a powerful hold on us that it is very easy to let it take over our minds and even our bodies if we are not careful. But where does strength fit into this?\n\t\t\tThe greater our strength and courage is, the less of a hold fear will have over us. Now, it is important to recognize that there is not some point where enough strength or courage will cancel out fear completely, nor would we want that, because that would lead to ignorance and pride, and eventually a fall. Where we want to be is a place where we hold enough strength and courage to accept fear for what it is, False Evidence Appearing Real, and use it as it is designed to be used; as an alarm, a detector, a guide, an indicator, a compass.\n\t\t\tYou are my strength, Alina. With you in my life holding me together with all of the steel wire threads you weave together inside of me, fear, worry, stress, anxiety, and all manner of negative emotions lose their grip on me, and instead I am able to grip them and use them as the tools nature intended them to be. I am able to navigate through life and see what is important, what is right and wrong (not just in general, but also for me, for you, and for us), and have the judgment necessary to make the right decisions at the right time. I‚Äôve told  you many times before, and I truly mean it when I say that you make me a better man. I am becoming the man I wish to be for myself, for you, and for us, thanks to you. I love you very much, Alina, very much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_title": "My Inspiration and My Motivation\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content": "\t\t\tI‚Äôve combined inspiration and motivation together into one section, and I‚Äôll explain why. But first, in order to explain why I‚Äôve chosen to combine them into one section, we need to understand what inspiration and motivation are, and their differences. Let‚Äôs begin by diving into what inspiration really is, and what it means when I say that you are my inspiration.\n\t\t\tSo, what exactly is inspiration? There are many definitions of what inspiration is, but one way I like to think about inspiration is that it is when the mind and spirit take flight. These moments of inspiration often feel transcendent, they appear without volition and arise from within, they slow or even stop the passage of time, and they amplify your senses, sometimes even sending shivers down your spine and causing goosebumps to rise on your skin. When these moments occur, new and creative ideas begin to manifest in the blink of an eye, as if a bolt of lightning has just struck them into existence in your mind.\n\t\t\tInspiration is a very mysterious, powerful, spiritual, and amazing component of life. Throughout the ages of human history, inspiration has been responsible for creating masterpieces of art, civilization altering feats of ingenuity, has brought immaterial ideas into physical existence in all shapes and forms across the world, and has even propelled these inspired ideas through the furthest reaches of our solar system. It is truly a beautiful and magnificent movement that breeds more knowledge and inspiration as those who experience one person‚Äôs inspiring idea become inspired with their own ideas.\n\t\t\tYou are my inspiration, Alina. When we are together, when we talk and laugh and contemplate with each other, you breathe inspiration into me even when you may not realize it. I see so many incredible things in my future, in your future, and most importantly, in our future together. There are ideas taking shape within my mind every day, and I am determined to make them a reality. You are the spark inside of me that ignites these moments of inspiration, and I wish to share all of these ideas and dreams with you, my world, my inspiration.\n\t\t\tNow that we‚Äôve explored a little bit about inspiration, what about motivation? What exactly is motivation anyway? Well, similarly to inspiration, there are many different definitions and explanations of what motivation is, but there is one way in particular that I like to view motivation. To me, especially when I am saying that you are my motivation, it is like a raging fire inside of me burning with passion and intensity that is driving me to accomplish these important inspired ideas that you have sparked within me. The motivation that you instill within me, is a powerful chain reaction, a lot like the fusion reactions that occur deep within bright stars that give them their ability to shine light into the universe and provide warmth and motion to the other planetary bodies revolving around them.\n\t\t\tIf you recall when you shared with me about your dance instructor telling you to visualize the ball of energy flowing and moving around in you, then you‚Äôll probably have a pretty clear image of the blazing sun inside of the very core of my being. That is the motivation I receive from you, and it is my internal source of power, my light, my direction, my warmth, my motion. I can do anything I set my mind to with you in my life, Alina, I believe this without a doubt and I know this to be true; just take a look at this book as a single piece of evidence amongst an ever growing list.\n\t\t\tThere are days in everyone‚Äôs life where maybe they feel tired, bored, or just not interested in doing something or moving forward with a goal they had previously set. I am also a human being (shhh, don‚Äôt tell anyone ;-) ), so of course I have days where I feel tired, but boredom and a lack of interest are non-existent. With you in my life, as soon as you are on my mind first thing in the morning, I am smiling the biggest smile, and I am ready to go and start my day. I can jump right out of bed and immediately start accomplishing things, no matter what the day is or how I am feeling. The sun never stops shining, nor does my motivation inside ever ebb or dim, because you are always here for me and you are always on my mind.\n\t\t\tThank you for always supplying me with all the motivation I need and more, my world. You truly are my motivation to get up, to move, to be successful, to prosper, to grow, to learn, to be better in every way, and so much more. You are my inspiration that sparks a new spirit and new creative ideas, and you are my motivation inside of me, burning like a bright star with limitless energy, light, and power to bring these inspired ideas to life.\n\t\t\tYou see, my world, inspiration and motivation go hand in hand. They each have their own distinct qualities of course, just like you and I each have our own distinct qualities, but when they are together, when we are together, creativity shines brightly and incredible ideas are born into our lives that take shape in the world, and in our world. My lovely world, I want you to know that I am both inspired and motivated by you to discover a life together. There are so many things we will explore, so many places we will visit, so many people we will meet, and so many accomplishments we will achieve, all while we are together, hand in hand. I want this and I wish for this life with you very much.\n\t\t\tTo finish this section, I want to share a quote with you about the differences between inspiration and motivation. Keep in mind that I created this quote based off of other quotes and articles I read about motivation and inspiration, so there are caveats of course, such as motivation being momentary and inspiration coming from within. While generally speaking this is true of motivation and inspiration, you are my never ending source of motivation, and my inspiration comes from you, my external cause. Here is the quote my world:\n\n‚ÄúMotivation is often momentary, but inspiration can last a lifetime.\n\nMotivation comes from an external source, while inspiration comes from within.\n\nMotivation pushes you, and inspiration pulls you.‚Äú\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "textsList.my_peace_title": "My Peace\n",
  "textsList.my_peace_content": "\t\t\tMy world, you are my peace and my serenity, and I hope you know how much this means to me. You know me, and you know that I am most often in ‚ÄúSeattle Mode‚Äù rushing around to get to work, to make it to physical therapy, going to the gym, trying to catch up on work, studying languages, working on my apps, making sure my apartment is clean and tidy, talking with my family, and the list goes on‚Ä¶ Every time we get on a call or text, however, I feel this amazing sensation that all the waves on the ocean of my life begin to fade into small ripples in the distance, and instead, a calm, peaceful, serene stillness begins to balance my life out from the center.\n\t\t\tMuch of my life has been filled with tidal waves and turbulence, which is unfortunately what I got used to for a long time. I thought that‚Äôs just how life is, and to be fair, life does get pretty turbulent at times, but you‚Äôve helped me to realize what I already knew deep down; life is what you make it. I know that‚Äôs a very simplified way to put it, but truly, it‚Äôs about how you make light of certain situations regardless of how ‚Äúturbulent‚Äù things get. Instead of getting pummeled by the waves and carried away in the rushing current, you just have to stand up and surf the wave.\n\t\t\tMy world, in life things often get chaotic and rushed, and ironically I have noticed that in these times details are often overlooked, forgotten, or missed entirely. This is how mistakes are made, and while failures are good because they can teach us how not to do something, mistakes are a bit different. At least in my mind, the difference between a mistake and a failure, is that a failure is an unfruitful attempt at something new or something you‚Äôre in the process of learning, whereas a mistake is an unintentional failure of something you already know how to do, because of inattention, ignorance, or being in a rush.\n\t\t\tI‚Äôve made many mistakes in my life, but in retrospect, it seems that the times I had the greatest clarity and achieved the greatest successes were when I felt most peaceful and observant; observant of myself internally, of myself externally, of my surroundings, and of my situation. Of course mistakes are an unfortunate and inevitable aspect of life that we have to endure, but we can significantly reduce these mistakes by truly being attentive and intentionally observing and applying ourselves in any given situation.\n\t\t\tKnowing what I know now, and feeling the incredible sense of peace and clarity I get from you, I can tell you with certainty that I wish to give you my full attention in life and I will not hold back when applying myself to being good to you, because I have observed myself with you in a new light that I have never seen before, and I like what I am discovering about myself with you. There isn‚Äôt a moment that I want to go through life without you, and I wish to observe even the most minute of details with you, because everything about you is amazing and worth remembering for a lifetime.\n\t\t\tYou are my surreal feeling of peace and calm that helps me to step outside of the storm of life, and see the beautiful colors that shine through onto the clouds. Life is about perspective, and that‚Äôs one thing I really love about you Alina. You always have a deep, interesting, and wise perspective that expands the way I think about life. Looking at a beautiful sunset with pinks, oranges, blues and purples reflecting off of the clouds and the sky, I can hear us talking about the incredible beauty in nature, and as fun as the thought experiment is to try and imagine a new color, we already have all that we need. All we have to do is look around us, and hold each other‚Äôs hands as we drink in the exquisite details from nature and life to know that we are complete with each other, and content with what life has so unselfishly provided to us without asking for anything in return.\n\t\t\tSomeday, maybe even someday soon (I hope so!), you and I can go for a nice peaceful walk through the desert mountains and look at the dark Arizona night sky together as the beautiful painted sunset fades under the horizon. Please, my lovely world, my peacefulness, take my hand and come explore with me. There is nothing I wish for more than to have you by my side, looking at these dreamlike skies with an awe inspiringly eloquent spectrum of colors speaking life and depth into the atmosphere, and an uncountable multitude of stars in the heavens stretching across the wide night sky.\n\t\t\tMy world, my peace, my serenity, my everything, I love you so much. I wish to hold your hand and walk through life with you as the sun sets and the world slows down. I wish to lie down with you in the grass underneath the stars, feeling relaxed and peaceful, making wishes as we see shooting stars, talking about how interesting and vast the universe is, and realizing how it‚Äôs amazing that even though we are so small and insignificant in the scheme of the universe, the love and feelings we share could make the galaxies rotate and the stars shine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "textsList.my_home_content": "\t\t\tWhen I am with you, truly I feel at home, like I am exactly where I belong and I am with exactly whom I am meant to be with. You‚Äôre right, that is a powerful statement, and I do not say it lightly. Even though this is a very powerful statement, I stand by it and I can assure you these feelings are true. There is not a single doubt in my mind regarding this, and that means a lot, because throughout my life there has been plenty of uncertainty, but not when it comes to this feeling.\n\t\t\tI have thought about when you said ‚Äúwe need to be honest with ourselves‚Äù many times, and I have kept myself aware of this while experiencing feelings for you and with you. One thing I‚Äôve learned from this (although I feel that I already knew this from the very beginning), is that with you, everything I feel when I‚Äôm with you is not only genuine, but it is powerful and deep, deeper and more powerful than I‚Äôve ever experienced before in my life. Inside of my heart and mind, you have illuminated me and cleared away anything that could obscure this illumination, which has revealed much and allowed me to discover more of myself than ever before.\n\t\t\tThere is something else you‚Äôve mentioned that has also stuck with me, although I have already known this as well. ‚ÄúHome‚Äù is not about a house, a location, or anything of the sort. No, the feeling of being ‚Äúat home‚Äù that I am speaking of has to do with a person; you. It doesn‚Äôt matter where we are, or what we are doing, as long as I am with you Alina, I am at home and I am where I am meant to be with who I am meant to be with. This feeling goes hand in hand with the peacefulness I previously described, because when I am home, I am free from my troubles, I am calm, I am happy, and I am comfortable.\n\t\t\tBeing at home with you is actually a culmination of everything I have previously told you, which is why I reserved this section for the end of the ‚ÄúYou are my <i>everything</i>‚Äù section. When we are home, this is where our most loving and intimate actions occur with each other. It could be lying in bed with you, looking into your deep blue eyes as I am running my fingers through your hair and telling you how much I love you, or it could be dancing in the kitchen together while cooking breakfast and wearing our pajamas, or it could be many other intimate things. The point is, my world, that home is where the heart is and where love is at its most present and tangible state, and yes, I love you and you have my heart. Please remember this when I tell you that I am at home when I am with you.\n\t\t\tMy world, you see, when we are at home, we are able to be ourselves, we can recharge, and we can be truly happy. This is why you are my happiness, because I feel at home with you, I can truly be myself, and you wash away any tiredness, any frustration, and any stress I might have been feeling. You always brighten my day, and much like we fill our houses with pictures that remind us of the happiest times in our lives, the memories I have and wish to create with you fill the walls of my mind with moments of true happiness. One of these particular moments I‚Äôll always remember, happens to combine the fact that you are both my love and my happiness, and it involves‚Ä¶ A portal :-)\n\t\t\tI mentioned before that home is where we can recharge and feel comfortable, and this is certainly true. When I am with you, I feel comfortable and happy, where your sweet words of encouragement nourish me and replenish my strength. Oftentimes, I have noticed that after spending even just a brief moment with you on the phone, I feel rejuvenated and motivated to not only accomplish everything I must do, but to achieve even more than I dreamed of. My endurance, strength, and motivation seem to be overflowing when I am with you, and I wish to tell you, that yes, you are very good to me and for me. You definitely have nothing to worry about when it comes to me not being happy or preventing me from accomplishing my goals, because you actually enhance and improve me in many different ways.\n\t\t\tThis extends much farther than the goals I already had and still have in my mind too. We have talked before about the night time at home being a time of creativity when we can finally do the things we wish to do without any worries or constraints that may have been on our minds during the day. With the lights dim and the music playing quietly in the background, I can let my thoughts flow into this book, into my coding, and so many more ideas you have inspired me to create. I can confidently tell you that with you, I am at home in my creative zone where I can let my ideas flow into the world, into our lives, for you, for me, and for us. You are my river of inspiration Alina, and I love you very much. I wish to fill our lives together with many interesting, fun, and memorable experiences that will last a lifetime.\n\t\t\tMy world, you truly are my home. As you‚Äôve said before, it doesn‚Äôt matter what country we are in, what city, what house or apartment. For me, home is wherever you are, and I wish to be with you Alina. I love you very much and I‚Äôve never wanted anything so much before. With you, I have such clarity about where I am going, where we are going, who I am and who I‚Äôm becoming, who you are and who you are becoming, who we are becoming together as a couple, as life partners, as teammates, and as even more than that‚Ä¶ Please take my hand, come home to me, and let‚Äôs go through life together learning, growing, exploring, and overcoming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I love you for who you are, and I love who I am with you. Being together with you truly makes me feel at home, complete, with all the pieces of the puzzle put together. Please know that I love you, I care about you, I only wish the best for you, I wish to help you make all of your biggest dreams come true, I will protect you and support you. If you ever need or want it, I will provide for you, but I will also respect you and empower you in your desire to accomplish things independently. I will care for you whenever you aren‚Äôt feeling well, and I will care for you when you are feeling better than you‚Äôve ever felt before. My point is that I wish for everything in life with you, my world.

This is the part in the story where finally I will tell you, but please let me at least say a few things first. I care about you very much and I respect you and your wishes, and these things that I want will require both of us, not just me and what I wish for. Keep in mind that while, yes, the following pages refer to things in the future, I am only painting a picture of what I see as possible with you, and that I wish for what we have now to continue as it is into this future painting.  So, please read on with this in mind and you will see exactly what I mean by ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. I am quite literally an open book for you to read‚Ä¶\n\t\t\tAlina, I love you with all of my heart, mind, body, and soul. I mean that with every molecule and every particle of my being, and I believe you can feel it too. Your unforgettable smile, heartwarming laughter, soothing voice, beautifully deep eyes, bright happiness, and big heart are only the ‚Äútip of the iceberg‚Äù of everything that I love about you, but this list grows every day with each new discovery. Truly, though, there are no words that exist that could possibly describe how beautiful and amazing you are to me, but I hope this book has begun to at least give you an idea of just how much you really mean to me.\n\t\t\tThroughout my life, I‚Äôve had many different kinds of jobs, played with many different hobbies, met many different people, and lived in many different places, all in the pursuit of finding myself. For the longest time, I had no idea what I really wanted, because there were so many different things I enjoyed and wanted to do, so I decided to try all of them until I found what I loved. It was not until I got into programming and web development that I finally started to see and realize what my passion, my hobby, and my career direction is.\n\t\t\tThis newfound direction and passion didn‚Äôt complete me though, and I could still feel an emptiness inside of me. I tried filling my time with more coding, more exercising, more entertainment, learning languages, and so on, but nothing could fill this void. Eventually, I decided to just accept it and move on. Aside from programming, one thing I really became passionate about and really enjoyed was studying languages. This led me to meet new people online from around the world, many of whom came and went over time. But there was something special about you from the very beginning. You never left my mind since we first started talking all those years ago. I ended up having some ups and downs, and I became absorbed into my studies and working, so I was distant for quite some time and I know we didn‚Äôt talk much. As I previously said, though, you never left my mind and finally I thought, ‚ÄúWell, now I can afford to go on a trip to Europe, I‚Äôve always wanted to go, and I could see if Alina would be willing to meet up with me in person.‚Äù\n\t\t\tSeeing where we are now, I am so glad that I decided to go, that I decided to ask if you‚Äôd be willing to meet me, and especially that you said yes. My life has changed so much since we started talking, and yes, in a very, very, good way. That feeling I had for most of my life of not knowing where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do, or who I wanted to be with, has faded into a distant memory. With you, Alina, I see clearly what I want in life, and I am speaking of all aspects, while leaving room for spontaneity and growth of course (we don‚Äôt always know what life has in store, but I‚Äôm open to everything, especially if it has to do with you). I know what I want in my career, I know what I wish to fill my time with, I know how I wish to contribute to the world, I know where I want to go, and yes, I know exactly who I want to be with.\n\t\t\tI want everything with you Alina, and I hope you will have everything with me. What is everything? Well, I will tell you. I want to be able to lie next to you every night in the same bed, so I can fall asleep with you in my arms. I wish to give you goodnight kisses, run my fingers through your hair, look into your beautiful blue eyes, and tell you that I love you and you are the only woman I want and need in my life every night before bed. I want to wake up next to you the following morning, every morning, and give you kisses as I get up to make you breakfast and coffee and help get your things ready for work while I also get ready for work.\n\t\t\tI want to be close to you, physically and intimately, and I am here for you to help you and support you with whatever you need to be successful. When we are together, I want to give you a life filled with dreams that have become reality and an abundance of happiness and love that never runs out. Sure, I know that life isn‚Äôt perfect and there will be down days and difficult times, but even when this happens, I wish to be right by your side to comfort you and help you through whatever is happening. And when I have my own down days and difficult times, I will be open and truthful with you, and we will get through everything together, because I know you are here, my world. My world, please know that through everything, through thick and thin, through happiness and melancholy, whatever life may bring us, no matter what I wish to be with you.\n\t\t\tI want to help you and be with you to get your first vehicle so we can go on drives together, driving to places we‚Äôve never seen and taking random streets just to see where they take us. I want to dance with you in the kitchen when we cook breakfast, and sing with you as we help each other wash the dishes afterward. I want to come home to you and intently listen to you share with me what happened in your day, even if it was just another day. I want to book our trip together to Santorini, Morocco, and Israel where we can explore new places and places we love together, meeting interesting people all along the way. I want to create our own websites, our own company, our own projects that we can work on together, because I want to be completely involved with you. It‚Äôs true, my world, I cannot get enough of you.\n\t\t\tSomeday, when the time is right, I want to be more than just your Man, Alina. I‚Äôve told you many times already that I don‚Äôt ever want a moment without you in my life, and I really mean it. I don‚Äôt care about time and I don‚Äôt want to scare you away by saying ‚Äúthe rest of my life‚Äù (though this seems quite fitting to how I feel), I just care about you and want to be with you, bottom line. I was uncertain for too long about too many things in my life already, and now that you are in my life, I finally see clearly everything that I want and need in my life. You are who I want and need in my life, Alina, you are the missing piece to my puzzle.\n\t\t\tI don‚Äôt know what the future holds, my world, nor do I wish to get caught up thinking of things that could be, but I know that I want you in it. You are my everything Alina, and I want everything with you. Let‚Äôs focus on the here and now, on us together, but I just want you to know that I truly want everything with you, I am committed and wholeheartedly devoted to you, and you can not only count on me being your Man, but you can count on me being even more than that for you when the time comes. Now, let‚Äôs go start a life together full of discovery, happiness, love, adventure, peace, and inspiration!",
