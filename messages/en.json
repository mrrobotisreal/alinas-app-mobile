I think you already know that, but I could never tell you too many times. Truly, my feelings and my love for you grow bigger, stronger, and brighter with every passing moment. This book and all the words contained herein are a representation of how I feel, but please know that they could never compare to how I truly feel for you. That being said, I wish for this book to serve you as a reminder of me and how I feel about you while we are not able to physically be together.\n",
  "textsList.introduction.p2": "\t\t\tI told you before that I was an open book for you to read and I will gladly share anything and everything with you that you wish to know. This book is proof that I really mean what I say to you, so please remember that when I tell you how much I love you, how much I treasure you, and how much you truly mean to me. You have also told me before that you wish for me to continue writing ‚Äúmy book‚Äù for you to read, and in response to you telling me this I just have one thing to say‚Ä¶ As you wish, my world, I will gladly do anything for you. And I decided to put at least some of it down onto paper for you to read any time you want.\n",
  "textsList.introduction.p3": "\t\t\tWhen you are feeling lonely and missing me, but I‚Äôm asleep or at work, I‚Äôll be right here in this book waiting to talk to you and keep you company. If you are having an amazing time and wish to share wonderful things with me, but for whatever reason you don‚Äôt have a signal on your mobile phone, please come here and tell me all about it in the section at the back of this book for you to write in. Whether you are feeling happy, sad, or in between, I will always be here for you. I don‚Äôt just mean in this book either, however, I hope this book will find you well in the times when we are not able to talk or see each other.\n\n",

But what is ‚Äúeverything‚Äù? This is something you‚Äôve asked me several times to tell you when we are finally together in Portugal. Of course I will do exactly as you wish, and I will also tell you in this book my world, because there may be times when you wish to come back and read it again and again, and let‚Äôs face it, scrolling back through our massive amount of texts isn‚Äôt that easy.\n",
  "textsList.the_anatomy_of_everything_content.p2": "\t\t\tYou should know, however, that ‚Äúeverything‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean just one thing. It means many things, and they can be placed into two categories, at least for the sake of elaborating it to you in this book. The first category has to do with when I am telling you that ‚Äúyou are my everything‚Äù, and as you might have guessed, the second category has to do with when I am telling you that ‚ÄúI want everything with you‚Äù. Let‚Äôs go ahead and dive right into what these are made of and what they mean!\n\n",

I love <u>YOU</u>. It‚Äôs almost a shame that in English, we don‚Äôt have a specific word that is reserved purely for expressing love and affection towards another person. Don‚Äôt let the multi-faceted use of this word fool you though. Deep within ‚Äùlove‚Äù, there is hidden power and beauty, much like a diamond deep within the Earth. It all depends how you say it, who you say it to, and when you say it.\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p2": "\t\t\t‚ÄúBut, my world, how does this relate to me being your everything?‚Äù you might ask. And I‚Äôd tell you that it‚Äôs related because much like the multi-faceted usage of this word, my love for you is also many-sided like the shapes of finely crafted and cut gems, which cause the light to refract and twinkle brightly in all directions. You are my love Alina, truly, you are the love of my life and the only woman I ever wish to be with in my life. I understand that is quite a powerful statement to make, but bear with me here and I think it‚Äôll begin to make more sense as I explain.\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p3": "\t\t\tYou see, when I look at you I can see how incredibly special, precious, beautiful, and powerful you are. Much like a jeweler pays close attention to the jewels they polish and every so slightly shape in order to let the light in to refract and magnify the beauty contained within, I wish to do the same for you, my love. Your beauty is like a bright light inside of you, and when I look at you, I see the real you and the brilliantly beautiful light you have shining within you. My love, I wish to polish every side of you that I can see, and watch your beauty shine brighter and brighter every day of my life‚Ä¶\n\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p4": "\t\t\tBut you are my love Alina, my one true love, the love of my entire life, and it just doesn‚Äôt seem like something as inanimate as a ruby or diamond does this explanation justice. No, my world, my love, you are so much more than even the most precious of gems and jewels that have ever been found or known to exist in the world. You are alive, and my love for you is alive and growing every day, with every breath. What better representation than a beautiful flower?\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p5": "\t\t\tYou are also my precious flower whom I wish to water every day with my love and care and attention, because with every moment, I see you blooming a little bit more into the magnificent and awe-inspiringly beautiful flower that I know you are. When I first met you in person in Prague, I could see you were so incredibly special and beautiful like a rose, but you had yet to bloom. I wasn‚Äôt about to miss the chance to watch you bloom into the amazing woman I know you are and that you will become, so I began watering you with every chance I got, by telling you how amazing you are and how I feel about you.\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p6": "\t\t\tI want you to know that I love you very much, Alina, more than I ever imagined was even possible, and I do not say this lightly. I mean it with every molecule of my being, and I wish for you to feel this love as I water you with my affection and care for you gently, sweetly, and passionately like the delicate and precious flower that I know you are. Just because something is delicate doesn‚Äôt mean it is weak either, so please do not think that anything bad is meant by saying you are delicate. No, in fact some of the most beautiful and incredible things in the world are delicate and intricately held together, and this only adds so much more to their beauty, to your beauty.\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p7": "\t\t\tI wish to be your gardener; I will care for you and protect you, and I will love you every day of my life. You can be sure of this my world. I will do anything for you, and I would truly cross the oceans and the mountains to be with you, to protect you, to care for you, to provide for you, to love you, and so much more.\n",
  "textsList.my_love_content.p8": "\t\t\tWe have something truly special and amazing together, Alina. Many people in the world dream of having something like what we have, and I do not take what we have for granted nor I do not want to waste or miss this opportunity of a lifetime. I want you in my life, for life, bottom line‚Ä¶ I am in love with you Alina, you are my love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p1": "\t\t\tHappiness truly is a feeling so great that the word ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù could never fully encompass the vast breadth and depth of what I actually feel when I am with you. What exactly is happiness anyway? Some might say it‚Äôs a good feeling that you experience while doing something you like, such as playing piano, dancing to a song you like, laughing at a funny movie, etc‚Ä¶ While I do agree that I would feel happy doing these activities too, this just isn‚Äôt what kind of happiness I‚Äôm talking about.\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p2": "\t\t\tNo, the kind of happiness I am talking about truly does extend much further beyond the ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù experienced while doing these enjoyable activities. When I say you are my happiness, Alina, I mean that you are the spark, the light, and the life within me that makes everything in life so much better and so much brighter. With you, my happiness, there is always a silver lining and warm light shining through even the darkest of days with gray skies and dim feelings. Bright days that are already filled with happiness and excitement of their own, well, my happiness, when you are with me they become truly unforgettable.\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p3": "\t\t\tI can tell you with certainty that before you came into my life, I didn‚Äôt know what real happiness was. Sure, I <i>thought</i> I knew what it meant to truly be happy, but in fact I had no idea what it really meant. You showed me the way, Alina, you lit my path as I walked through life with you and everything became brighter and sweeter, and I could see even the finest of details in everything around me. If you‚Äôve ever looked closely at the stitches in a piece of finely woven clothing with intricate patterns, then you‚Äôll understand when I say that when I am with you, I am so happy that I can see the elaborate and magnificent weave in all things around me, even in the dullest of objects and the blandest of subjects.\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p4": "\t\t\tYou see, my happiness, ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù is actually a combination of many feelings working together in harmony with each other, and the actual ‚Äújoy‚Äù and ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù we feel is an emergent property emanating out of this harmony. We can definitely find enjoyment and pleasure in life by ourselves, of course, but true happiness is not something we could achieve or find on our own, and when we do find it, it is greater than the sum of any amount of pleasure or enjoyment we could get or find on our own. You are my happiness, Alina, because without you, I would never have known what this harmonic blessing of a feeling meant or felt like.\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p5": "\t\t\tSometimes, no, very often actually, I say to myself ‚Äúwow‚Äù, full of wonder and awe. There is nothing in my life that has ever even come close to this kind of happiness I have with you, my world. You‚Äôve seen it in me, I know, but I still feel like telling you this‚Ä¶ Every time I see your beautiful smile, deep blue eyes, long golden hair, and hear your heart melting voice and your spirit lifting laughter, I truly cannot help but smile and feel the utmost elation and wonder. I don‚Äôt know how you do this to me, every single time I see you, and I don‚Äôt need to know, but I truly treasure you and you are so precious to me, more than these words could ever describe.\n",
  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p6": "\t\t\tYou really are my happiness Alina; ‚Äúyes‚Äù ;-), you are. There is something special about you, and I have felt that ever since the moment I met you, but now I really see that brilliant light inside of you growing brighter by the day, with each passing moment. Maybe it‚Äôs because I am seeing just how special and amazing you are more every day, maybe it‚Äôs because that light inside of you is growing brighter every day, or maybe it‚Äôs a combination of both, but I can see it, sense it, and feel it, and it‚Äôs the most beautiful and incredible thing I‚Äôve ever seen. That light I‚Äôm talking about, it‚Äôs you; you are the most beautiful and incredible woman I have ever seen, ever met, ever known. You are my happiness, Alina, and you are my harmony, and you are singing and shining the most breathtaking symphony ever to exist inside of me.\n\n",

  "textsList.my_happiness_content.p10": "\t\t\tI would like to take this quote even a bit further with you, my happiness, because the happiness I feel with you goes beyond myself, and it is not just about me. The happiness I feel with you is also when what I think is what you say, when what you think is what I say, and when what we do is in unison. I‚Äôm sure you have noticed all of the times when I‚Äôve ‚Äúread your mind‚Äù, and I sure have noticed all the times when you have read my mind; we are in harmony together, we are happy together, we are one together, and we belong together. Alina, I love you very much and I have never been happier before in my life, truly. YOU are my happiness, and because of you, now I know what true happiness is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "textsList.my_strength_content.p1": "\t\t\t^ Maybe you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúwhat in the world does this steel wire rope have to do with me being your strength‚Äù? Well my world, let me tell you, because I find that it is actually quite fitting. Oftentimes the greatest amount of strength possible comes from the unification of many small components working together, being flexible, and using physics and leverage, rather than resisting physics and gravity. If you really want to dive deep, think of the incredible and almost unfathomable amount of energy stored inside the atoms of a molecule, and how incomprehensibly many molecules make up even just a centimeter of one of these tiny steel wires.\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content.p2": "\t\t\tMuch like each of these individual strands that are woven together, which make the rope as a whole incredibly strong and also flexible by distributing the pressure evenly in all directions, the little things you tell me and do for me hold me together and make me stronger than I could ever be by myself. Before you entered my life, I was like a single thick, inflexible strand trying to hold all the pressure of life by myself. I‚Äôm sure I probably don‚Äôt even need to say it, but trying to handle all of that stress and pressure rigidly by myself is a fracture waiting to happen. But now that you are here, now that you are in my life, you are my strength; you always tell me little sweet things that lift me up, give me encouragement, boost my confidence, remind me that my attitude is a choice and directly impacts the way I experience life, and help me to see that success is near.\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content.p3": "\t\t\tEach of these seemingly ‚Äúlittle‚Äù things you do for me, are actually making up the individual steel wires that wrap around each other, giving me the strength and the flexibility to know that even when the pressure is intense, you are always here in many ways, and sometimes I just need to give way to the pressure a little bit in this direction or that direction until it evens back out. My world, thank you so much for every ‚Äúlittle‚Äù thing you do for me. I appreciate you so much, I absolutely treasure you and I recognize how amazing you are and the things you do for me.. Maybe it isn‚Äôt very apparent on the surface at times, but inside you build me up and support me, and I know that no matter what life throws at me, I will be okay.\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content.p4": "\t\t\tBut this goes beyond just being okay. In fact, with you I feel that I can think big and I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, and overcome any obstacle. There is, however, another aspect to strength that sometimes gets overlooked, but it is very important and very powerful. This aspect is fear. I know, I know my world, but just hear me out.\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content.p5": "\t\t\tFear definitely has very negative connotations, but it is also an incredibly powerful tool, and there is a reason nature has imbued it with such power in our minds and bodies. It drives us to recognize and act upon what is both important and dangerous for our survival and happiness. This is also a slippery slope though, because fear has such a powerful hold on us that it is very easy to let it take over our minds and even our bodies if we are not careful. But where does strength fit into this?\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content.p6": "\t\t\tThe greater our strength and courage is, the less of a hold fear will have over us. Now, it is important to recognize that there is not some point where enough strength or courage will cancel out fear completely, nor would we want that, because that would lead to ignorance and pride, and eventually a fall. Where we want to be is a place where we hold enough strength and courage to accept fear for what it is, False Evidence Appearing Real, and use it as it is designed to be used; as an alarm, a detector, a guide, an indicator, a compass.\n",
  "textsList.my_strength_content.p7": "\t\t\tYou are my strength, Alina. With you in my life holding me together with all of the steel wire threads you weave together inside of me, fear, worry, stress, anxiety, and all manner of negative emotions lose their grip on me, and instead I am able to grip them and use them as the tools nature intended them to be. I am able to navigate through life and see what is important, what is right and wrong (not just in general, but also for me, for you, and for us), and have the judgment necessary to make the right decisions at the right time. I‚Äôve told  you many times before, and I truly mean it when I say that you make me a better man. I am becoming the man I wish to be for myself, for you, and for us, thanks to you. I love you very much, Alina, very much.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_title": "My Inspiration and My Motivation\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p1": "\t\t\tI‚Äôve combined inspiration and motivation together into one section, and I‚Äôll explain why. But first, in order to explain why I‚Äôve chosen to combine them into one section, we need to understand what inspiration and motivation are, and their differences. Let‚Äôs begin by diving into what inspiration really is, and what it means when I say that you are my inspiration.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p2": "\t\t\tSo, what exactly is inspiration? There are many definitions of what inspiration is, but one way I like to think about inspiration is that it is when the mind and spirit take flight. These moments of inspiration often feel transcendent, they appear without volition and arise from within, they slow or even stop the passage of time, and they amplify your senses, sometimes even sending shivers down your spine and causing goosebumps to rise on your skin. When these moments occur, new and creative ideas begin to manifest in the blink of an eye, as if a bolt of lightning has just struck them into existence in your mind.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p3": "\t\t\tInspiration is a very mysterious, powerful, spiritual, and amazing component of life. Throughout the ages of human history, inspiration has been responsible for creating masterpieces of art, civilization altering feats of ingenuity, has brought immaterial ideas into physical existence in all shapes and forms across the world, and has even propelled these inspired ideas through the furthest reaches of our solar system. It is truly a beautiful and magnificent movement that breeds more knowledge and inspiration as those who experience one person‚Äôs inspiring idea become inspired with their own ideas.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p4": "\t\t\tYou are my inspiration, Alina. When we are together, when we talk and laugh and contemplate with each other, you breathe inspiration into me even when you may not realize it. I see so many incredible things in my future, in your future, and most importantly, in our future together. There are ideas taking shape within my mind every day, and I am determined to make them a reality. You are the spark inside of me that ignites these moments of inspiration, and I wish to share all of these ideas and dreams with you, my world, my inspiration.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p5": "\t\t\tNow that we‚Äôve explored a little bit about inspiration, what about motivation? What exactly is motivation anyway? Well, similarly to inspiration, there are many different definitions and explanations of what motivation is, but there is one way in particular that I like to view motivation. To me, especially when I am saying that you are my motivation, it is like a raging fire inside of me burning with passion and intensity that is driving me to accomplish these important inspired ideas that you have sparked within me. The motivation that you instill within me, is a powerful chain reaction, a lot like the fusion reactions that occur deep within bright stars that give them their ability to shine light into the universe and provide warmth and motion to the other planetary bodies revolving around them.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p6": "\t\t\tIf you recall when you shared with me about your dance instructor telling you to visualize the ball of energy flowing and moving around in you, then you‚Äôll probably have a pretty clear image of the blazing sun inside of the very core of my being. That is the motivation I receive from you, and it is my internal source of power, my light, my direction, my warmth, my motion. I can do anything I set my mind to with you in my life, Alina, I believe this without a doubt and I know this to be true; just take a look at this book as a single piece of evidence amongst an ever growing list.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p7": "\t\t\tThere are days in everyone‚Äôs life where maybe they feel tired, bored, or just not interested in doing something or moving forward with a goal they had previously set. I am also a human being (shhh, don‚Äôt tell anyone ;-) ), so of course I have days where I feel tired, but boredom and a lack of interest are non-existent. With you in my life, as soon as you are on my mind first thing in the morning, I am smiling the biggest smile, and I am ready to go and start my day. I can jump right out of bed and immediately start accomplishing things, no matter what the day is or how I am feeling. The sun never stops shining, nor does my motivation inside ever ebb or dim, because you are always here for me and you are always on my mind.\n",
  "textsList.my_inspiration_and_my_motivation_content.p8": "\t\t\tThank you for always supplying me with all the motivation I need and more, my world. You truly are my motivation to get up, to move, to be successful, to prosper, to grow, to learn, to be better in every way, and so much more. You are my inspiration that sparks a new spirit and new creative ideas, and you are my motivation inside of me, burning like a bright star with limitless energy, light, and power to bring these inspired ideas to life.\n",

My lovely world, I want you to know that I am both inspired and motivated by you to discover a life together. There are so many things we will explore, so many places we will visit, so many people we will meet, and so many accomplishments we will achieve, all while we are together, hand in hand.

Keep in mind that I created this quote based off of other quotes and articles I read about motivation and inspiration, so there are caveats of course, such as motivation being momentary and inspiration coming from within. While generally speaking this is true of motivation and inspiration, you are my never ending source of motivation, and my inspiration comes from you, my external cause.

  "textsList.my_peace_content.p2": "\t\t\tMuch of my life has been filled with tidal waves and turbulence, which is unfortunately what I got used to for a long time. I thought that‚Äôs just how life is, and to be fair, life does get pretty turbulent at times, but you‚Äôve helped me to realize what I already knew deep down; life is what you make it. I know that‚Äôs a very simplified way to put it, but truly, it‚Äôs about how you make light of certain situations regardless of how ‚Äúturbulent‚Äù things get. Instead of getting pummeled by the waves and carried away in the rushing current, you just have to stand up and surf the wave.\n",
  "textsList.my_peace_content.p3": "\t\t\tMy world, in life things often get chaotic and rushed, and ironically I have noticed that in these times details are often overlooked, forgotten, or missed entirely. This is how mistakes are made, and while failures are good because they can teach us how not to do something, mistakes are a bit different. At least in my mind, the difference between a mistake and a failure, is that a failure is an unfruitful attempt at something new or something you‚Äôre in the process of learning, whereas a mistake is an unintentional failure of something you already know how to do, because of inattention, ignorance, or being in a rush.\n",

Looking at a beautiful sunset with pinks, oranges, blues and purples reflecting off of the clouds and the sky, I can hear us talking about the incredible beauty in nature, and as fun as the thought experiment is to try and imagine a new color, we already have all that we need. All we have to do is look around us, and hold each other‚Äôs hands as we drink in the exquisite details from nature and life to know that we are complete with each other, and content with what life has so unselfishly provided to us without asking for anything in return.\n",

  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p1": "\t\t\tJudge Raymond Elisando sat confidently and intently in his seat within the courtroom. The prosecution is pitching their closing statement at the moment, but Raymond doesn‚Äôt really need either the prosecutor or the defense attorney to know whether or not the defendant is guilty. No, because he has a secret, and this secret has been helping him move up the ranks quickly in his career.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p2": "\t\t\tWhat is this secret? Well, you see, Judge Elisando happens to be able to see auras around people, particularly the people relying on his verdict and judgment on sentencing. To him, it‚Äôs abundantly clear when someone is guilty or innocent. When a defendant is truly innocent, there‚Äôs always a bright, constant, clear shine around them. It‚Äôs almost as if there is a bright white light shining directly onto the defendant, and they are in ultra-high definition, whereas everything else is just standard definition. Kind of like when a camera focuses on something or someone, and the background isn‚Äôt quite as clear.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p3": "\t\t\tNow, when a defendant is actually guilty of whatever they have been charged with, there seems to be a strange distorting kind of shimmer surrounding the person. It‚Äôs almost as if all around the defendant there is a huge heat source causing the air around them to be heated up so much as to produce the distorting heat waves you might see rising off of the hot asphalt in an Arizona summer.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p4": "\t\t\tEven though this is the case and he has this special ability, he still goes along with the usual show, because if he were to share this strange little secret, people would think he is crazy! They would surely throw him out of his position and maybe even send him to a mental institution. Seeing as how his career has been taking off quickly, it seems like he‚Äôs made the right decision in both using this unusual ability and keeping it a closely guarded secret. Now he‚Äôs sitting here in the courtroom once again, waiting for ‚Äúthe show‚Äù to finish so he can deliver the judgment he already knows he‚Äôll make.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p5": "\t\t\t‚ÄúSo, given the evidence we‚Äôve provided, your honor, we believe the defendant is not only guilty of possession of a controlled substance, but also guilty of having the intent to sell and distribute it, based on the amounts they were found to have in their possession. I have no further comments to make, your honor, I believe the evidence clearly speaks for itself. Thank you.‚Äù, says the prosecutor, Mr. Eddie Thompson, as he walks back to his side and sits down. Eddie gathers up all of the documents lying on the table, taps them on the table to line them all up and then puts them back into his briefcase.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p6": "\t\t\tThe defense lawyer, Mr. Victor Broughton, stands up, approaches Judge Elisando, and begins to say his closing remarks, but Raymond is looking directly at the shifting, distorted aura shimmering around the defendant. `Sorry Victor, but this guy is guilty as can be. It doesn‚Äôt really matter what closing remarks you have to say, because I definitely see jail time in the defendant‚Äôs future.`, Raymond thinks while looking intently at the defendant, or rather at the aura emanating from the defendant like waves of heat from a stove.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p7": "\t\t\t‚Äú... and that‚Äôs why we ask that you consider the entirety of the circumstances surrounding this case, your honor. Yes, my client has had a troubled past and clearly has a substance abuse problem, but he is by no means a drug dealer or distributor. Thank you.‚Äù, finishes Victor, walking back to his side and taking a seat with a confident look on his face. The defendant leans over to talk with Victor, and there is some whispering, and the defendant nods his head and mouths ‚ÄòThank you so much.‚Äô\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p8": "\t\t\tFinally, the show is about to  be concluded, but there is one more act left to play. It‚Äôs Raymond‚Äôs turn to put on his acting face now. He has to at least make it look like he‚Äôs actually considering all of the information that the prosecution and defense has just provided. Otherwise, people might start to catch on that his mind was already made up the moment the defendant walked in the door, and who would trust that judgment? That would reek of bias and prejudice to everyone, and admittedly Raymond completely understands and would feel this way too if he were in their shoes and didn‚Äôt know about his ability. Hence the need to put on a good show for the people.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p9": "\t\t\tJudge Elisando sat there, wearing his most convincing look of contemplation on his face, with his elbows on the table and his fingers slowly tapping together. Sometimes, this is the hardest part of the job. Not making the actual judgments, that‚Äôs actually the easy part thanks to his uncanny ability to see these auras, but finding a convincing way to explain why he is making this particular judgment, that‚Äôs the hard part. He can only use what information has been presented to him as his reasons, and lately, this has become even more difficult given his quick rise through the ranks and taking on more difficult cases.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p10": "\t\t\tNonetheless, he delivered his verdict after acting out much internal deliberation. ‚ÄúBased on all of the evidence provided, I find the defendant guilty of all charges,‚Äù Raymond said in his most confident and authoritative voice. Immediately, surprised murmuring can be heard throughout the courtroom, and naturally, a shocked and hurt look on the defendant‚Äôs face can be seen. Victor happened to look shocked as well, but also a bit concerned, hadn‚Äôt he presented a convincing case for his client not to be convicted of the intent to distribute illegal substances?\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p11": "\t\t\t‚ÄúOrder, order, please, order in the courtroom. Now, although I find the defendant guilty of all charges, let the record show that I will take into consideration all of the defense‚Äôs remarks when determining the sentencing for these charges.‚Äù This soothed the murmuring in the courtroom, but only a little. Despite this less than agreeable response from the courtroom, Judge Elisando stood and left the courtroom, heading back to his office.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p12": "\t\t\tRaymond shrugged off his black gown and let out a deep sigh as he sat down, interlocked his fingers, placed his hands behind his head and leaned back in his office chair. He closed his eyes and immediately a river of thoughts began gushing through his mind. Soon he would have to serve as judge for some upcoming cases that are very high profile, much higher profile than he had served on before in fact. While the prospect of launching his career even higher into the atmosphere of success with these upcoming cases seemed like an incredible opportunity, he couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit worried about how he would defend his judgments.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_1_content.p13": "\t\t\tRecently, it‚Äôs been more and more difficult to portray a convincing response, given the shocked looks and surprised murmuring after the court case he had just finished presiding over. People just don‚Äôt understand, and they wouldn‚Äôt understand even if he explained his ability. `I guess this is just a small price to pay, I shouldn‚Äôt be complaining about feeling a little discomfort when making a tough judgment. I‚Äôd be doing this city a disservice if I wasn‚Äôt using this incredible ability.` he thought, watching thoughts swim around in his mind. Then he chuckled to himself. `Tough judgment, now that‚Äôs funny. The difficult part has nothing to do with the judgment...`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p1": "\t\t\t‚ÄúRay, is everything okay?‚Äù Raymond‚Äôs wife Siloah asked him with a concerned look on her face as she sat down on the couch next to him. He let out a long sigh as he stared vacantly into space, swirling his glass of whiskey and making the ice clink against the sides of the glass. ‚ÄúYeah, everything is okay Sil, thank you for always being so good. I‚Äôm just a bit stressed about this murder case I have to preside over tomorrow. I‚Äôve never worked a case with this much publicity before, nor with this magnitude of charges‚Äù, he responded, snapping out of his vacant stare and looking into Sil‚Äôs eyes with gratitude and love.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p2": "\t\t\t‚ÄúWell, I think it‚Äôs completely reasonable to feel a bit stressed or nervous before a case like this, but you know what? I‚Äôve known you to judge hundreds of cases before this, and clearly you have the ability to do this. You‚Äôll be fine. I love you and I support you completely, Ray, just remember this okay?‚Äù, she said as she leaned forward to hug Ray and put her head on his shoulder. He lifted his chin slightly and turned to lean his head over onto hers. `Hah, it‚Äôs not the ability to judge this case that I‚Äôm worried about`, he thought.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p3": "\t\t\tIn that moment he wished more than anything that he could share his deepest secret, but despite this urge to share it with his most beloved friend and partner, his wife, something even deeper within him nagged and pushed him away from divulging it to her. He kissed her head and said, ‚ÄúI love you Sil, you‚Äôre the most amazing woman I know. Maybe you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve come this far already and I intend to keep going. As long as I have you, I‚Äôll be alright.‚Äù Ray took two large swigs from his glass of whiskey, and fought back the stress eating away at him.\n\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p4": "\t\t\tThe next morning he woke up to his alarm blaring repeatedly, and unfortunately, he also woke up to a pounding headache. ‚ÄúAghhh‚Äù, he grunted as he reached for his phone to shut the alarm off. `What a wonderful way to start the morning of my big case`, Ray thought sarcastically as he sat up and placed his feet into his slippers next to the bed. He rubbed his eyes and massaged his temples while thinking `Good grief, my head is really killing me right now. I didn‚Äôt even drink that much whiskey last night, just one glass. Must‚Äôve been dehydrated too I guess.`\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p5": "\t\t\tHe walked into the kitchen and drank a full glass of water, then refilled it again and took some Paracetamol to relieve the pain. ‚ÄúGood morning Silly‚Äù, Ray playfully joked with Sil as he walked up and kissed her in the kitchen. She chuckled and kissed him back, replying ‚ÄúGood morning old man‚Äù with a smirk as she flipped over the eggs frying in the pan. ‚ÄúWhoa, whoa, who are you calling old?‚Äù he retorted, laughing and already beginning to feel better. ‚ÄúThanks for the breakfast dear, you are the best. I didn‚Äôt even hear you get up this morning‚Äù, Ray said as he sat down at the kitchen table. ‚ÄúWho says this breakfast is for you?‚Äù, Sil said tauntingly with a smile, turning to look at Ray. He met her gaze, raised one eyebrow, then began smiling as they both started laughing.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p6": "\t\t\tA few moments later she brought over a plate of eggs, hash browns, and bacon with a glass of orange juice and set it in front of him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to do great today Ray, I believe in you. Enjoy your breakfast and drink your orange juice, it should make your head feel better and then you‚Äôll be ready to go.‚Äù ‚ÄúThank you, Sil. Have I ever told you that you‚Äôre the best? Because you are‚Äù he said as he took a big bite of food. ‚ÄúLove you‚Äù he said in a muffled voice with a mouth full of food. Sil laughed and kissed his forehead, ‚ÄúLove you too‚Äù.\n\n",

  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p8": "\t\t\tRaymond sat behind the big oak desk in his office, with the early morning light shining in from the window behind him and casting light onto the pile of documents he was reading. With his thumb massaging his right temple and his fingers on his forehead, he sighed and continued reading the document held in his left hand in front of him. Not only was his head still bothering him, but this case was turning out to be a bigger deal than he initially realized.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p9": "\t\t\tOriginally, he was under the impression that this was a murder investigation with some strange circumstances, but now it‚Äôs come to light that this defendant isn‚Äôt just some random person. The defendant is Quinton Franks, son of the wealthy and famous politician and business owner, Mason Franks.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p10": "\t\t\tAt a young age Mason had immigrated here with his parents, who then started a real estate business and quickly became wealthy. As he grew up, Mason loved going with his father to view the different real estate properties that were being bought and sold. This ended up providing him with many opportunities to meet other wealthy and famous people interested in the properties, including many different politicians and government officials, inspiring Mason to pursue a career in politics.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p11": "\t\t\tGiven that Mason, even from a young age when first meeting all of these officials, left a memorable impression on them as a clever and charming young man, it came as no surprise to the community when he ended up being elected as a State senator. Shortly after Mason‚Äôs election, however, his father passed away and left the family real estate business to him.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p12": "\t\t\tMany people worried about what would happen to either the business or Mason, thinking that there was no way he could handle both, but these worries were soon quashed when he married Cheryl Binds. Cheryl Binds, now Cheryl Franks, came from another family owned real estate business and knew exactly how to keep the business alive. Not only did she keep the business alive, but she expanded the business and began contracting towers to be built in major cities like New York, Seattle, and San Francisco, which propelled the family wealth into the top 10% of the country.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p13": "\t\t\tAbout a year after the third tower was built, Mason and Cheryl had their son Quinton. Quinton had every opportunity to excel in life. He went to prestigious schools, met many famous politicians, business owners, and actors, who were all charmed by him, just like his father Mason. The difference with Quinton, however, is that he had a tendency to deal with some of the shadier characters in the world of business and politics.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p14": "\t\t\tThere had been at least a couple of occasions in the news where Quinton had been accused by whistleblowers for using his connections and power to influence business purchases and elections of officials that he supported, yet these officials did not seem to have the community support one would expect to see for an official that had supposedly been elected by the community. But as many of these accusations against high ranking people go, they were thrown out as hearsay and charges were dropped. The accusations did leave their mark on his reputation though, and the community had their growing suspicions and doubt of his trustworthiness.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p15": "\t\t\tThis information reeled in Raymond‚Äôs mind, making his head begin to pound again. He reached for the glass of water to his right and drank the entire glass, crunching and chewing the remaining ice as he continued to read the details of the murder Quinton was being accused of. Raymond‚Äôs eyes fervently scanned line after line of text, absorbing and digesting the information, fighting off any prejudices attempting to work their way into his mind.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p16": "\t\t\tIn the affidavit, Quinton is being accused of masterminding a plot to ‚Äútake care of‚Äù a problematic realtor, Mr. Jefferson, who leaked information about a scheme to launder money by purchasing property from a shady politician. Mr. Jefferson leaked documents that proved this transaction was not only money laundering, but also bribery, because Quinton actually already owned this property and essentially paid this politician as a bribe, using the purchase of property from the politician as a way to launder the money by making it look like the politician owned the property.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p17": "\t\t\tWhen Mr. Jefferson failed to come home after work, his family called the police to report him missing, because they were already aware that he had leaked this information to a reporter and were worried something may have happened to him. Later it was discovered that the day Mr. Jefferson failed to come home after work, he had been showing a new property to Quinton in a remote area. Police found CCTV footage of Quinton and Mr. Jefferson driving together in the same vehicle on the way to the property, but on the way back only Quinton could be seen in the vehicle.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p18": "\t\t\tLater, Mr. Jefferson‚Äôs family was told by an associate of his that he expressed worry over showing this property to Quinton alone, and then his family presented this information to police. Eventually when police found that Mr. Jefferson had ‚Äúfallen‚Äù from a cliff, and they put together the suspicious evidence, the murder charges were made against Quinton.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p19": "\t\t\tDespite how suspicious all of the events surrounding the case seemed and how they seemed to be pointing directly at Quinton as the prime suspect, the prosecution was hard pressed to find any other evidence to directly tie him to the crime. At the scene there was no evidence of a struggle, in the CCTV footage Mr. Jefferson did not seem to be distressed while driving on the way out there, examining both Quinton‚Äôs and Mr. Jefferson‚Äôs phones yielded no incriminating or even remotely suspicious text messages, and furthermore, Quinton clearly and obviously hired the best lawyer he could afford, and he could afford more than most people in the country. Still, there was motive based on Mr. Jefferson leaking the information, Quinton was seen leaving without Mr. Jefferson after viewing the remote property, and the claims from the family and work associate about his worry to show this property to Quinton alone.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p20": "\t\t\t‚ÄúWhat am I getting myself into?‚Äù Raymond sighed to himself, setting the documents down and leaning back in his chair. He reached for his glass of water and rubbed his temples again, but realized the glass was empty. Walking over to the pitcher to pour some more water, Raymond mentally flipped through all of the potential ways this case could play out.\n\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p21": "<i>In the courtroom, the case is beginning‚Ä¶</i>\n\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p22": "\t\t\t‚ÄúAll rise‚Äù, said the bailiff as Judge Elisando entered the courtroom from the door behind his raised desk, and approached his seat. Immediately the murmuring of the court began to quiet down, and clicks and flashes could be heard and seen as the reporters tried to get the best angles before court was in session.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p23": "\t\t\t‚ÄúThank you, you may be seated‚Äù, Ray said as he too sat down at his raised desk. ‚ÄúNow, let‚Äôs set the record showing that this is just the preliminary hearing. After the prosecution has proclaimed the charges against the defendant and their merit for making these claims based on whatever evidence may be presented, the defense will have a chance to refute any accusations made by the prosecution and the defendant will plead either guilty or not guilty. From that point, I will make the judgment on how this case will proceed. Are we in agreement with these proceedings?‚Äù\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p24": "\t\t\t‚ÄúYes, your honor‚Äù, both the prosecution and defense responded simultaneously. ‚ÄúGood, then Mr. Thompson please proceed‚Äù, Raymond instructed. Mr. Eddie Thompson, the prosecution, thanked him as he stood up and straightened his tie.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p25": "\t\t\tWalking toward the bench where Judge Elisando sat listening intently, Eddie began to disseminate all of the facts to the courtroom that Ray had previously been reading about in his office. When Ray happened to look at the defendant, Quinton, however, he noticed something strange with his aura. Looking directly at Quinton, he could only see a constant bright white aura of ultra high definition being emanated, but as Ray turned to continue looking at Eddie as he laid out the charges and evidence, he noticed a faint distortion and shimmering out of the corner of his eye.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p26": "\t\t\tTo confirm his suspicions, Ray continued to look at Eddie, but his focus was on the corner of his eye where Quinton was sitting. Sure enough, there it is. That same guilty shimmering distortion was definitely there. But how could this be? Ray had never seen anything like this before. Previously, it was always abundantly clear whether or not the defendant was guilty, but this time, it was almost as if Quinton was purposefully ‚Äúwearing‚Äù an innocent aura despite his guilty shimmering aura being emanated underneath his peculiar form of ‚Äúclothing‚Äù.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p27": "\t\t\t`Truly, what am I getting myself into?``, Raymond thought to himself, feeling a bit worried now about how this case will turn out. Again, he focused on the corner of his eye where Quinton was calmly seated, not moving a muscle or displaying any kind of emotion whatsoever. Sure enough, that distorted shimmer was there.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p28": "\t\t\tRaymond subconsciously began massaging his temple with his left hand, as that deep pain started to manifest behind his eyes again. `Man, maybe I need to look into a new prescription again. These glasses seem to work just fine, but focusing on the corner of my vision like that is not making my head feel happy, that‚Äôs for sure.`, he thought, continuing to rub his left temple.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p29": "\t\t\tFinally, Eddie had finished presenting his charges and the evidence to support them, and the defense, Mr. Victor Broughton, stood up to begin his representation of the defendant. As Victor presented his defense, however, Ray was having trouble listening, because all he could seem to think about was how strange Quinton‚Äôs aura was.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p30": "\t\t\tWhat finally ended up snapping Ray back to attention in the present moment was the defendant, Quinton, pleading ‚Äúnot guilty‚Äù. Now he knew it was his turn to carry on the show, and said ‚ÄúOnce the court has selected jurors for the trial, we will reconvene and both sides will have their opportunity to present the evidence and defense in depth to the jurors.‚Äù Ray stood up to leave back to his office and the bailiff once again said ‚ÄúAll rise‚Äù as he walked and opened the door to his office.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p31": "\t\t\tClosing the door behind him, Ray let out a deep sigh and began massaging both of his temples, wincing at the pain behind his eyes. He walked back over to his office chair and took several swigs of the barely cool water left in his glass covered in condensation from the melted ice. Once the glass was empty, he inadvertently set the glass down forcefully which ended up shattering all over his desk and onto the floor.\n",
  "theJudgeTextsList.chapter_2_content.p32": "\t\t\t‚ÄúDamnit‚Äù, he said to himself. That‚Äôs when the unsettling thought occurred to him, what if this is an omen or a symbol of how this case will end up? But if it is, who‚Äôs the one that will end up shattered and in pieces, him or Quinton? Ray swallowed dryly and thought, `I hope not me`, but his gut was telling him something different‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
