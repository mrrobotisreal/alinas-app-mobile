## About the "I love you Alina ❤️" app

<section>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This app is simply a project I decided to create for my amazing and beautiful girlfriend, Alina Kaliberda. It serves 2 main purposes:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      The first purpose is it serving as an app for her to be able to use with her anywhere she goes. It contains books I've written for her, audio I've recorded for her, videos I've created for her, albums of our photos we've taken together, and even a way to leave me messages.
    </li>
    <li>
      The second purpose being that this project has served me as a way to learn and practice mobile development using the technologies mentioned below, while simultaneously adding to my public portfolio.
    </li>
  </ol>
